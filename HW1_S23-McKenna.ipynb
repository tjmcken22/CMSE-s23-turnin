Additionally, we must ensure we have a list of the variable names we would like to use for certain categories, assuming we don't use the fundamental column/row names. Each team should have their own branch they work on, one called ANALYSIS and the other called VISUALIZATION. When changes are made and commits and pushes occur, we will require that the message includes the editors last name, analysis or visualization, and a short note on what they changed. This will help us search in the git log if errors or mistakes occur. \n",

    "<font size=+3>&#9998;</font> Debugging is the process in which you try to figure out the catalyst for the error in your code. My best method of debugging starts with going line for line, searching primarily for minor errors such as spelling, spacing, variable name, missing (), etc. After determining the error isn't a minor one, make sure your methods are correct, and you can do this by using prior assignments to compare similar code that worked. This is the best way of using your resources to debug, as it gives you a guide to base your own code on. Finally, if all else fails, try a google search with the following format: \"what you are trying to code here\" python. This can give you example code or step by step instructions on the method you are trying. It is always great to have someone else read over your code as well, as sometimes we get tunnel vision and can't spot a minor error that a fresh set of eyes would. Coding is very tidious, so don't get frustrated right away when something goes wrong."
